              Over the years, the city has been a link between various cultures. In the past, Tangier was both an Amazigh (Berber) town and a Phoenician trading center. It also passed through the hands of the Romans, Vandals, Visigoths, and the Umayyad Empire. A Carthaginian Empire settlement dating back to the 5th century B.C. called “Tingis” by the Greeks inspired Tangier’s current name. <br>As of 1923, colonial powers considered Tangier a city of “international status” and it became a landing for diplomats, businessmen, and spies. It was also a mecca for gamblers and an “El Dorado” for the upper class. Essentially, Tangier was not under the jurisdiction of Morocco for a long period of time. From 1923-1928 it was deemed a “neutral demilitarized zone” under the joint administration of Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. Beginning in 1928, it also was administered by Portugal, Italy, and Belgium, and in 1929, the Netherlands joined on. The United States followed during World War II, using Tangier as its operation base for its Office of Strategic Services.<br>As of 1956, Tangier was reintegrated into Morocco. Due to its complex administrative history, it became well-known for being a hub of cultural and religious diversity.<br>According to popular legend, the demigod Hercules founded Tangier. Amazigh mythology suggests it was founded by Surfax, a different hero from Amazigh and Greek mythology.

            <aside>
              "Never in my life have I observed anything more bizarre than the first sight of Tangier. It is a tale out of the <em>Thousand and One Nights</em>... A prodigious mix of races and costumes...This whole world moves about with an activity that seems feverish." <br>— Eugène Delacroix, in a letter to Alexis de Tocqueville</br>

                    Few cities have had a more varied history than Tangier. Existing already as a Phoenician trading post in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, it later became Carthaginian; the remains of a Carthaginian settlement can still be seen near Cape Spartel. In 81 BCE the Roman general Quintus Sertorius captured the city (then known as Tingis) from the Mauretanian king Bocchus I. Becoming a free city in 42 CE, Tingis was made the capital of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana, with the name Tingis Colonia Julia Traducta, and it remained important commercially even after the political capital was removed to Volubilis.<br>After five centuries of Roman rule and a brief occupation by the Vandals in the 5th century, Tingis was captured by the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century. When the Arabs arrived in the 7th century, however, Ceuta, not Tangier, seems to have been their principal fortress on the strait. The Arab general ʿUqbah ibn Nāfiʿ (Sidi Okba) reached Tangier in 682 and from there raided deep into Morocco. In 707, when Mūsā ibn Nuṣayr was appointed governor of North Africa, he had to reconquer Tangier; the Amazigh (Berber) Ṭāriq ibn Ziyād was appointed governor and in 711 launched an invasion of Spain, where his landing point, Gibraltar, still bears his name as a corruption of Jabal Ṭāriq (Mount Ṭāriq). In 951 ʿAbd al-Raḥmān III of Córdoba, the first caliph of the western Umayyad dynasty, annexed the city, and it remained under Muslim Spanish rule until the collapse of the caliphate about 80 years later. Under the Almoravids, Tangier became Moroccan again and—despite a failed attempt to conquer the city by the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator in 1437—remained so until captured by the Portuguese in 1471.  It then kept being passed between the Portugese, the Spanish and the English at the expense of maintaining the city against Moroccan attacks and the Protestant suspicion that it was a centre of Roman Catholicism, which led it to be abandoned again in 1684 and remaining as part of Morocco again.

                <h3>Modern History</h3>
                <p>
                  Tangier became the diplomatic capital of Morocco in the 19th century, and in 1845 Sir John Drummond Hay began his four-decade tenure there as British representative in Morocco; throughout that period British trade and political influence predominated in the region. In 1844 Tangier was bombarded by a French fleet as part of French campaigns against the Algerian emir Abdelkader. The Spanish then invaded Morocco in 1860, thus challenging a British policy aimed at preventing any Continental power from securing control of the southern shore of the Strait of Gibraltar. This situation led the British to issue a warning that a permanent Spanish occupation of Tangier or of the nearby Moroccan coast would not be permitted. About the same time, various foreign powers began to establish their own postal services, and in 1864 a lighthouse was established at Cape Spartel that was maintained by the consuls.<br>Tangier was seemilingly the <strong>crush</strong> of many powerful countries, which makes us wonder : <em>who won it over in the end ?</em> The answer is <em>no one, really</em>.

                  The result of these activities and privileges was that Tangier received an international regime of its own when the rest of the country became a French protectorate in 1912. Already in the proposed Franco-Spanish Agreement of 1902, the two powers had been willing to see the city eventually become neutral, and the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 stipulated that Tangier should have a special status. With the establishment of the French protectorate, a commission with French, Spanish, and British members was appointed to oversee the administration of Tangier, and by 1914 it had with difficulty agreed on certain recommendations. The outbreak of World War I necessitated fresh discussions, and a statute was not agreed upon until 1923. Five years later further modifications were introduced, with Great Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Portugal, and Italy being recognized as the administering powers. This statute remained operative until June 1940, when Spain took advantage of the fall of France during World War II (1939–45) to occupy the zone in the name of the khalīfah of Tétouan and to impose a Spanish regime on the city. After the war the victorious Allies insisted on Spanish withdrawal, and in October 1945 the international administration was reestablished, with the participation of the United States; Italy, an Axis country during the war, was readmitted later. With some minor modifications, the statute then remained in force until the independence of Morocco in 1956.
